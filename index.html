    <h1>Self-Driving Car</h1>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Your objective is to create the perfect self-driving 
        car that will speed past and avoid all traffic. <br><br>
        You have 100 cars that are all making different decisions on 
        how to avoid traffic using their 5 sensors. <br><br>
        
        When your car makes a good decision, 
        hit the "save" button to save their brain. 
        If they crash, hit refresh to try again with the brain of your previous save. 
        Everytime your car makes a good decision, 
        hit save again. If after several refreshes 
        your car keeps crashing, hit the "trash" button 
        to discard his brain and start over. <br><br>
        Creating the perfect car takes a lot of trial and error (as it should) so be patient and good luck!
